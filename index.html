                            I am an <strong>Associate Professor</strong> in the Department of Economics at <strong>Universidad del Pacífico (UP)</strong>. I hold 
                            a Ph.D. in Economics and a Master’s in Economics and Financing of Aging, both from <strong>Tilburg University</strong>, as well as a 
                            Bachelor’s in Economics from <strong>Pontificia Universidad Católica of Peru (PUCP)</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout my career, I have taught at various universities and conducted research and policy analysis across multiple 
                            institutions and countries. My primary expertise lies in evaluating the impact of public policies on <strong>pensions</strong>, <strong>health</strong> and the 
                            <strong>well-being of vulnerable populations</strong>. My research focuses on the effects of <strong>social health insurance</strong> on workers, 
                            the impact of <strong>social pensions</strong> on the elderly, and the influence of <strong>childcare programs</strong> on maternal mental health.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have also led <strong>Randomized Control Trials (RCTs)</strong> on retirement and financial savings, funded by organizations such as 
                            <strong>Innovation for Poverty Action (IPA)</strong>, the <strong>Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)</strong>, and UP. My work has been published in 
                            prestigious academic journals, collective volume chapters, and one book.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond academia, I have substantial experience as a <strong>policy-maker</strong> and <strong>international consultant</strong>. I played a key role in leading 
                            <strong>pension reforms</strong> while working for Peru’s <strong>Ministry of Economy and Finance</strong> and have recently advised the 
                            <strong>Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)</strong> on pension policy projects and recommendations for 
                            various Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries.
